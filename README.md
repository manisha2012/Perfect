# PerfectMatchApp

### Technologies Used : React Native, Redux, Firebase

This app is based on the concept that if a user likes someone (must be a Facebook friend), but unable to express him/her, can send a request to the friend. If friend also likes him/her, he/she will also send a request. There will be a match, & they can start chatting. At a time there can be only two active chats to ensure serious relationships. Also, user can keep any of his chats active/inactive.
